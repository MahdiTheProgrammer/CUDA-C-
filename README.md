# A Deep learning framework from scratch with CUDA/C++

## Features
All of the following features support batch input which alongside with gpu acceleration, provides a descent performance.
  ### Layers:
  - Conv2d
  - Linear
  - ReLU
  - MaxPool2d
  - Flatten
  - Softmax
    
  ### Loss Functions (Working on it!):
  - MSE
  - CrossEntropy
  - BCE
  - Huber

  ### Optimization Functions (Soon will be added):
  - SGD
  - Adam
  - RMSProp

  ### TODO
  - add RNN, LSTM, transformer support
  - Autograd

## Test Dataset
For testing and demonstrating the functionality of the library I will use the CIFAR-10 dataset (binary version). The dataset is available in:
