# I am builing a Deep learning framework from scratch with CUDA/C++

## Features
  ### Layers:
  - Conv2d
  - Linear
  - ReLU
  - MaxPool2d
  - Flatten
  - Softmax (soon)

## Build Instructions

## Usage

## TODO
- Transfomer and attention mechanism
- Autograd



## Update
At the moment all the CNN layers work properly with their forwardpass. I haven't build a model yet but the model should work perfectly fine. I will start working on backprop as soon as I get everything ready.
