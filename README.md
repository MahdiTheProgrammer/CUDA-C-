# A Deep learning framework from scratch with CUDA/C++

## Features
All of the following features support batch input which alongside with gpu acceleration, provides a descent speed.
  ### Layers:
  - Conv2d
  - Linear
  - ReLU
  - MaxPool2d
  - Flatten
  - Softmax

  ### TODO
  - add RNN, LSTM, transformer support
  - Autograd
  - Optimization and loss functions
## Dataset
For testing and demonstrating the functionality of the library I will use the CIFAR-10 dataset (binary version). The dataset is available in:
```
cs.toronto.edu

## Build Instructions

## Usage



## Update
At the moment all the CNN layers work properly with their forwardpass. I haven't build a model yet but the model should work perfectly fine. I will start working on backprop as soon as I get everything ready.
